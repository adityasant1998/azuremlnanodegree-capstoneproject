# Heart Failure Predictions Using Microsoft Azure ML Studio

This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree. The Heart Failure Clinical Records Dataset is used to train a machine learning model that predicts mortality by heart failure. The model is developed using Hyper Drive and Auto ML methods, and the model with the highest accuracy is retrieved (voting ensemble in this case) and deployed in the cloud with Azure Container Instances (ACI) as a webservice, with authentication enabled. Once the model is deployed, the endpointâ€™s behavior is analyzed by getting a response from the service and logs are retrieved at the end. 
## Dataset

### Overview
This Dataset is available publicy in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data
The dataset is publicly available on Kaggle. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioral risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity, and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies. People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help. 

### Task
The task of this project is to train a model to predict whether the person with cardiovascular disease will survive or not. To access the dataset, two different methods were used for two different models.

### Access
For HyperDrive Approach: Dataset from a public repository, loaded with TabularDataset.
For AutoML Approach: Dataset registered from local files, loaded from Azure workspace.

## Automated ML Approach and Results
Tired of manually tweaking machine learning models? Say hello to AutoML: your shortcut to automated model development! AutoML takes the pain out of repetitive tasks, letting Azure Machine Learning train and optimize models based on your desired metric.

Here's how it works for our heart failure prediction project:

Data Prep:

We register the Heart_Failure_Clinical_Records_Dataset.csv from our local files into the Azure workspace.
Before converting it to a pandas dataframe, we create the workspace, experiment, and compute cluster.
AutoML Configuration:

To run AutoML smoothly, we define an AutoMLConfig with specific settings and compute target.
This includes setting the experiment timeout to 30 minutes, task type to Classification (predicting categories of new data), primary metric to accuracy (model effectiveness), and other parameters like label column, cross-validations, training dataset, allowed concurrent iterations, and automatic feature engineering.
Model Arsenal:

AutoML taps into a variety of models like LightGBM, SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest, and ensemble approaches like Voting and Stacking.
It also pre-processes data using various techniques like scaling and normalization to enhance model performance.
Visualization and Model Selection:

Once the experiment runs, we use the Notebook widget to track progress and visualize results.
Upon successful completion, the best model is retrieved and saved for further use.
In summary, AutoML simplifies model building by automating tedious tasks and offering a powerful toolbox of algorithms and pre-processing techniques. This lets you focus on what matters most: interpreting results and applying the best model to solve your problem.

Here are the screenshots of steps that I took to use AutoML in Azure ML studio:

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.
